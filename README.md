# KinderGuardians 🛡️

KinderGuardians is a cutting-edge child safety monitoring platform that uses advanced audio processing and machine learning to help parents keep their children safe online and in real-world interactions.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time text analysis
- Machine learning-powered content moderation
- Instant parent notifications for concerning content
- Secure WebSocket connections for live updates
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Machine Learning**: Python processing
- **Text Analysis**: Custom ML models

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd kinderguardians
```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:
```bash
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. Start the server:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

2. Start the client:
```bash
